I thought this project was the perfect balance between difficulty and "doability." It was tough, but I never felt like I wouldn't be able to make it work. It felt so good when I finally got the previous and next buttons to work, and it was a lot of fun figuring out how to move the map to show the geolocation the user clicked on. I was also pleasantly surprised when I figured out how to display the place names on the map without custom code, but rather through built-in Google maps functionality.
