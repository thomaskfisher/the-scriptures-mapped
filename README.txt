Project 1b:

I had never done any CSS or jQuery animations, so I really enjoyed this project. Actually creating the animations was pretty simple, the tricky part was figuring out where in the javascript functions to call the animations. For the next and previous chapter animations I had a simpler idea in mind than what you mentioned in class, and I was able to implement it successfully but I'm not sure if what I did was brilliant or janky. I just have one div that I slide out of view, make it transparent, move it to the other side, make it opaque again, and then slide it in from the opposite side. Also, I hadn't used Flex box before this class so I ran into some difficulty using your code and making it mobile responsive, but eventually I got it!



Project 1a:

I thought this project was the perfect balance between difficulty and "doability." It was tough, but I never felt like I wouldn't be able to make it work. It felt so good when I finally got the previous and next buttons to work, and it was a lot of fun figuring out how to move the map to show the geolocation the user clicked on. I was also pleasantly surprised when I figured out how to display the place names on the map without custom code, but rather through built-in Google maps functionality.
